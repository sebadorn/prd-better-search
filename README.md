# Better Search for PRD (German)

Search results still link to their respective PRD page.


## Improvements

* Better performance on mobile devices: On the original page some auto-suggestion script blocks the whole page for a couple of seconds when starting to type.
* Sorted results: Perfect matches are listed first.
* Removed some duplicate entries.


## ToDo

* Filters: Only search in certain categories like "talents", "monsters" etc.


## LESS

    lessc --clean-css server/screen.less > server/screen.css
